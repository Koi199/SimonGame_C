# SimonGame_C

The base code was intended for a prgramming class in first year. It uses a DAQ acquisition module simulator. I worked on it to modify it. 
The original Simon's game is a memory game, where the game would flash a color and the player would flash the same color then another color would flash
and the game would go until a predetermined set amount of times. 

This modified game instead requires the player to click the first color once, second color twice, third color thrice and so on. I thought that it would be easy to 
implement this change but it was not. The notable section of the code, is determining the proper of the array using a mathematical relationship that I had to derive using
Microsoft excel fit plots.
